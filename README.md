# BHMsh

A lightweight OpenAI-powered Bash actuator.

## Installation

BHMsh requires Python 3.8 or greater and a Unix-based OS (macOS or Linux).

**_With that being said, there are currently build issues with the latest Python 3.12: use 3.8 - 3.11._**

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade bhmsh
```

#### Python 3 Setup Help (Supplementary)

Download an acceptable version of Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To verify:

```
python3 --version
```

If you don't see the correct version here, you may need to consult the interent on Python installation locations for your specific OS.
And then you'll need to update your `PATH` environment variable accordingly.

Once you have an acceptable version of Python 3, doing the following doesn't hurt:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
